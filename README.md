# Passion Project: Discord Bot Scheduler 

The DB Scheduler is a bot that can be imported into discord that pings people who are given a specific role to attend or decline an event. An event can consist of scheduling a movie night for people to watch online together or a time when everyone can get together for tabletop games. All members of the discord regardless of role will have access to the bot to set up an event and ping those with the specific role for attendance. The scheduler will work by creating a post or message in the channel specified and add reactions for the people to select attendance, a “yes,” “no,” or “maybe” reaction will appear on the post and refresh with those who have selected an option within that post. The people who have reacted “yes” to the bot will then be sent a private message on discord and ask if the person would like a reminder notification for the event scheduled. As well as being able to schedule and set up events, there will be an option to store game rules for the bot to list given a command. These rules can start as the generic tabletop game rules and can have custom rules added in as well. This bot will be available for download on schedulemebot.com.

This bot is designed for people who are long distanced or simply have another platform to spend time with friends, family, etc.

The Scheduler bot will add convenience for matching schedules, encourage get-togethers, and reconnect with old friends! Imagine sharing your favorite movie with those haven’t seen it before or finding a time where you can finally play that new board game you’ve been waiting to try.

The MVP for this bot will allow people to create/cancel events, set up reminders for those attending, be able to edit or change events and notify the people attending, and set up or state rules of different tabletop games. 

I plan on using Java, Spring, SQL, and React for the front end.
